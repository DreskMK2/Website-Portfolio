I have a degree in Industrial Design and Product Development engineering from Jaume I University (Castelló de la Plana, Spain).

I’m interested in different areas related to design and innovation, above all in lighting and furniture.

Now I’m open-minded to all the experience and formation I can get to improve my projects.
