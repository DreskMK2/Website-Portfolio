Riviera is a tile designed for Harmony inspire brand by Peronda. It was designed during my internship in Yonoh Design Studio in 2019.

The collection is composed of nine tiles of soft lines that remember to us the riverside (in fact the meaning of Riviera). The user can mix the tiles and rotate them to create a unique creation.
